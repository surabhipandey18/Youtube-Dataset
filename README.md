# YouTube Like Count Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a YouTube dataset to explore relationships between video features such as likes, comments, duration, tags, and view counts. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling using Linear Regression and Random Forest.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (duration, tags, published hour)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (visualizations of tags, categories, duration, and published hours)
- Predictive modeling for view count using likes, comments, and duration
- Model evaluation and feature importance analysis

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Place `youtube_data.csv` in the project directory.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook `youtube_like_count_dataset.ipynb` to execute the analysis.

## Structure
- Data loading and cleaning
- Feature engineering
- EDA with visualizations
- Model training and evaluation
- Feature importance visualization

## Results
The notebook provides insights into which features most influence view counts and compares the performance of different regression models.
